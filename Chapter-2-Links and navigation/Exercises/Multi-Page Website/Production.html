                            On July 15, 2019, a TV series adaptation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series was announced by Amazon. Nick Santora, who created Scorpion, was set to write, showrun, and produce the series through Paramount Television and Skydance Media.
                            On January 14, 2020, the TV series was greenlit, with Don Granger, Scott Sullivan, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Marcy Ross, and Christopher McQuarrie as executive producers with Child. The first season was announced as an adaptation of Child's novel Killing Floor.
                            In July 2021, it was announced M. J. Bassett had joined the series as a director. <br>
            
                        <br>
            
                            On February 7, 2022, Amazon Prime Video renewed the series for a second season. To adapt the books to screen the writers decided they would need to make Reacher verbalize his thoughts more often, 
                            but that they would keep his dialogue short and direct and have him only speak longer to people he respects. They also decided to introduce Neagley to the series earlier than in the books. On December 2, 2023, ahead of the second-season premiere, it was revealed that filming of a third season had begun.
